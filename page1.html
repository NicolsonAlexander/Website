        One of the biggest changes I’ve made to my life recently is my backyard garden. Over the year I’ve experimented with growing produce from leftover scraps and seeds we picked up on a whim. It has really made a major impact on my lifestyle and improved my health, both physically and mentally. We’re going to go back a little bit to see how this all started. We consume and dispose of a ton of food. I’d like to say that I suddenly “came to the realization that we needed to be more self sufficient and start cutting back on our food expenses to save the planet”. In reality it was mostly because I liked green onions.<br>

        Now green onions (also known as scallions) are easily one of my favorite vegetables. I can have them in basically anything, from salads to noodles. We would always be buying them in bulk but that freshness would never last. However that’s when I decided to start saving the bulbs. I had seen videos showing you could just plop the bulbs into water and they’d start growing again. It was fast and easy; which was appealing to someone lazy like me. And so, I got out a thin cup and filled it with a tiny bit of water and plopped the onion bulbs into it.<br>

        Within a day I already was seeing the results and it encouraged me to keep doing it. Of course there was only so much you could do with just water and if I wanted long term results, I’d have to get my hands dirty. Luckily the rest of my family wanted to get back into gardening so the timing was perfect. With bags of soil and new pots to start planting it, we were ready to get growing. However we weren’t going to stop with just green onions. I started eyeing up any veggie that had started to go off and began looking for ways to salvage it.<br>

        Potatoes have always been a major part of the family diet. Mashed, baked, fried, you name it and we’ve eaten it. Earlier in the month we had purchased a sack of potatoes and some of them had started to go off. With ‘eyes’ emerging on the earthy surface, they weren’t the most appealing to eat. Same as before I looked up a tutorial and consulted some guides. I took the potatoes and carved them into halves. I had to ensure that the eyes were facing upwards when face down. After letting them sit overnight, I planted them first into a barren patch of stony soil under my window. And as more potatoes were ready for planting I populated every barren patch of dirt.<br>

        I learned from all this planting that the quality of the soil impacts growth dramatically. The potatoes growing in the stony soil did not do nearly as well as the potatoes in the raised bed.<br>

        I learned from all this planting that the quality of the soil impacts growth dramatically. The potatoes growing in the stony soil did not do nearly as well as the potatoes in the raised bed.<br>

        That is really the root of what I’m trying to convey here. It’s all about doing. Just getting started with whatever little scraps you’ve got and working from there. Experimenting with your backyard, some stony soil, a handful of potatoes, and few leftover onion bulbs. Now growing green onions and potatoes is all well and good. However we had gotten our hands dirty and that green thumb we’d acquired wasn’t going to be satisfied yet. From now on we were going to harvest any seeds that we could; ranging from tomatoes, butternut squash and eggplant. We were fully dedicated to growing and started to invest in raised beds for all our new crops.<br>

        We ended up scouring a few locations looking for well priced raised beds that would be simple to set up. These give you so much freedom to grow whatever you want. However we ran into some problems. While the raised beds are great for specific crops, it meant that we couldn’t easily move them around. Tomatoes for instance require a lot of sunlight and it’d be great to be able to move them into the sun then indoors if it gets stormy. This taught us a few things, like how it’s good to diversify your options and think ahead. Had we just plopped our tomato plants in the soil by the window, it wouldn’t have gotten nearly enough sunlight<br>

        Ultimately we had a few pots hanging around and they worked out fabulously. The wonderful thing about tomatoes is that they just keep growing throughout the year and as long as you keep up with pruning. Even unripe tomatoes can be saved by placing them in direct sunlight.

        Nowadays we’ve saved the seeds from the tomatoes we grew to plant in the spring. Typically there is a way to salvage any produce.<br>

        On the other side of the issue where we made a mistake was with our pumpkins. Now I’ve always wanted to grow pumpkins and give them out at Halloween to friends and family. However where we plopped them didn’t get enough sunlight and pumpkin plants are very susceptible to mildew.<br>

        This is where we made a mistake planting them where we did. Out of that batch we only got 1 pumpkin out of 4 that made it. However it wasn’t all doom and gloom, it was a learning experience. These growing pains were necessary. Now we know better and will be ready for when spring arrives. (On the plus side we have plenty of seeds from the pumpkins that did make it so we’ve have plenty of chances.)<br>

        There was a similar story with our squash plants which are very similar to pumpkins. Next time around we’ll do better and that’s what’s important. Being able to bounce back and realizing that not all experiments work out.<br>

        For a period we were able to eat straight out of the garden. Pick cucumbers straight off the vine and prepping them for salads. For first timers we were doing pretty well for ourselves.<br>

        In these cold winter months it’s easy to fall into that seasonal depression especially with all these current world events. While there are a few crops we’re growing indoors, we’re currently just in a period of hibernation. Waiting out the cold and dreaming of spring.<br>

        It’s given me a lot of time to reflect and think about the future. Thinking about self sufficiency and growth.<br>

        Ultimately at the end of the day we started growing for pragmatic reasons but I think by doing that it’s helped me a lot mentally. I had mentioned in the first blog post that it had improved my health and here I’ll elaborate more on that.<br>

        It felt good to be able to save food and be able to provide even if it was only for a dozen or so meals. And now I feel smarter and more in control, knowing that next spring we’re going to create an flourishing ecosystem in our backyard.

        Before all this I’d spend the entire day on my computer or watching videos on the couch. Getting out and more importantly doing things really helped clear my head. I’m the happiest I’ve ever been and I get to eat the fruits of that labor literally. It’s a satisfying accomplishment.

        I can’t think of a reason to not try to grow your own crops. Even if it’s just a plastic cup by the windowsill. That’s a net gain for a little effort.<br>

        The recurring theme I found in all of this is that a lot of happiness is found in pragmatic accomplishment. We’re not talking about being the richest or most famous, we’re talking about putting a potato in some dirt. Dirt, my friends is the key to happiness.<br>

        I’m only half joking when I say that. (There are many keys to happiness.)<br>


        Now I’m a bit of a layman so I don’t know much about philosophy and such. What I do know is that shaping my territory and growing beautiful plants which I can later eat put a skip in my step. Being able to drop by a friends place and drop off a bundle of veggies, that’s the stuff I remember and feel good about to this day.<br>

        There’s a connection to the earth and to our roots. Before there were supermarkets and mass farming, this is what most people did. Grow their own food and forage for it.<br>

        I’m hoping by sharing this that maybe it’s inspired someone else out there to take up gardening or even just putting that one onion in a cup of dirt to see what happens.<br>

        It all comes down to taking that first step and just starting. Get some table scraps and just start ‘doing‘. There will be some stumbling but every mushy pumpkin is a lesson to be learned.<br>
